**Data Set: Pizza Sales Data**
The dashboard appears to be a "Pizza Sales Dashboard," which means the underlying data set likely contains records of individual pizza sales transactions.

**Key Fields (Columns) in the Data Set:**

1) Date: The dashboard shows a "Date Sales" slicer with dates like "01 January 2023," "02 January 2023," etc. This suggests a date field is present for filtering sales by day.

2) Pizza_Code: This is a crucial field. The chart titled "Count of Pizza_Code, Code and Sum of Price_USD by Pizza_Code" implies a unique identifier for each type of pizza.

3) Price_USD: A numerical field representing the price of a single pizza or a sales transaction. The dashboard shows "Sum of Price_USD," so this field is used for aggregation.

4) Count of Pizza: The dashboard shows "Sum of Sales" as "413." This is likely a count of individual pizzas sold. The underlying data might have a field for the quantity of pizzas per transaction, or each row could represent a single pizza sale. The name "Count of Pizza_Code" in one of the charts reinforces this.

5) Unsold: The dashboard shows "Sum of Unsold" as "39." This suggests a field that tracks the number of unsold pizzas. It might be a count or a flag (e.g., 0 for sold, 1 for unsold) per item.

6) Category: A categorical field. The pie chart is titled "Count of Pizza_Code by Category" and shows categories like "Veg" and "Non-Veg." This field classifies each pizza.

7) Count of Pizza_Code: This is a measure, but it's likely based on a field that counts the number of pizzas.
